# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

### Robin wanted to make her web app run appear better. TO do this, we used BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape images of Mar's hemispheres. 

## Description

### Mongo, Flask, Python, and Jupyter Notebook tools were all utilized to write and execute the code to ensure this project was a success. 

## Conclusion

### When pulling information from html sources, it is important to ensure the correct data is highlighted so the correct code line is selected. Also, the coder needs to remember to test the code at various points so the code doesn't get too far into fruition with a mistake having been created.
